# Rust Guessing Game

### Source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality

My first Rust project, a game that randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, to which the user has to guess.

To run the program, ensure you have Rust and a Compiler installed. Then, type ```cargo run``` inside the project directory.

If the number you guess is too small, the program will respond with ```Too small!``` before allowing you to type again.

If the number you guess is too big, the program will respond with ```Too big!``` before allowing you to type again.

If the number you guess isn't a number, you will simply be prompted to guess again.

If you guess correctly, the program will respond with ```You win!``` before ending.

To force close the program, press Ctrl + C.

This program covered many new Rust concepts including, let, match, loops external crates, and error handling. It was fun!
